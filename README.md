# MoodPlaylistGenerator
This program uses the Spotify API to curate a playlist of songs based on the user's current mood. It presents a list of moods and prompts the user to select one. Then, it retrieves a relevant playlist from Spotify and randomly selects 8 songs to present to the user. The output includes the song name, artist, and a Spotify link to each song.
